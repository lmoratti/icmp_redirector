# ICMP Redirector

This tool performs a simple ICMP redirect attack. This attack can be used to redirect traffic through an attacker-controlled machine. 

ICMP redirects can manipulate the routing behavior of the target system by injecting routing information into the routing cache. Entries in the routing cache overwrite those in the routing table, until the entries expire. To be more specific, we are adding to the "FIB Nexthop Exception Cache" [4]. This is an important distinction because Linux prior to Kernel version 3.6 contained a routing cache which was deprecated for performance reasons. MacOS and Windows are opaque harder to experiment/speculate on.

ICMP Redirector is designed for educational and ethical penetration testing purposes. Do not pentest systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

## Features
* Sends ICMP redirect packets to the target machine to manipulate its routing table cache.
* CLI Support for pentesting & scripting
* Includes helpful documentation in-line 

## Known protections against ICMP Redirection
``` If we spoof redirect packets, but the victim machine has not sent out ICMP packets during the attack, the attack will never be successful. This is because the OS kernel conducts some kind of sanity check before accepting an ICMP redirect packets. [3]```


### Known OS Kernel Sanity Checks
```... the OS kernel conducts some kind of sanity check before accepting an ICMP redirect packets. It verifies whether the ICMP redirect is triggered by [a] packet it sent out ... How strictly the checking is conducted depends on the OS. [3]```  


This checking is more easily bypassed by sniffing for ICMP traffic and then copying an authentic ICMP packets information. 

* Ubuntu 20.04 
    * The operating system verifies that in the Internet Host header inside the ICMP payload matches the type and the destination IP address of the original packet that triggers the ICMP redirect.

* Ubuntu 22.04 
    * The checking is more strict. The ways it is more strict is unknown.

* Windows 
    * Unknown. Please add sources if you are aware of the behavior or research it yourself.

* MacOS 
    * Unknown. Please add sources if you are aware of the behavior or research it yourself.


## Getting Started
To install 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Usage

```python3 icmp_redirect.py --target <target_ip> --destination <destination_ip> --gateway <gateway_ip> --attacker <attacker_ip> [--redirect_code <code>] ``` 

### Parameters
    --iface              [optional] The interface to sniff ICMP on. Requires interface in monitor mode / or to be in a MITM position already. 
    --target             [required] The IP address of the target who should add the routing table cache entry.
    --destination        [required] The IP address of the destination. The target will insert a route for this IP via the attacker.
    --gateway            [required] The IP address of the gateway we're spoofing as.
    --attacker           [required] The IP address of the attacker.
    --redirect_code      [optional] The redirect code from the ICMP redirect RFC [2]. Supports values 0, 1, 2, and 3.

### ICMP Redirect Codes [2]
    0: Redirect datagrams for the Network.
    1: Redirect datagrams for the Host (default for this tool).
    2: Redirect datagrams for the Type of Service and Network.
    3: Redirect datagrams for the Type of Service and Host.

## Example
To perform an ICMP redirect attack where the target 192.168.1.2 is tricked into routing packets destined for 192.168.1.100 through the attacker 192.168.1.3 using 192.168.1.1 as the gateway:

```python3 icmp_redirect.py --target 192.168.1.2 --destination 192.168.1.100 --gateway 192.168.1.1 --attacker 192.168.1.3```
